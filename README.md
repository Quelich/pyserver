# PYSERVER

This is a simple python server that can be used to serve HTML files.

## Usage

### Server

Start the server by running the following command:

```bash
python .\server.py
```

Use a browser to navigate to `http://localhost:3000/HelloWorld.html` to view the index page.

### Client

Start the server and then run the following command:

```bash
python .\client.py localhost port filename
```

Localhost is the IP address of the server, port is the port number of the server, and filename is the name of the file to be requested.
